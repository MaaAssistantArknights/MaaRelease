### 📢 [MAA × MirrorChyan] Community Sponsorship Program

MAA has officially integrated **[MirrorChyan](https://mirrorchyan.com/?source=maa-anno-en)** — a paid distribution platform designed for open-source communities.

🤝 **Revenue Sharing**

Revenue generated via **MirrorChyan** will be used to support:
- The **MAA Official Website**
- The **Copilot / Strategy Station**
- Ongoing **server and infrastructure maintenance**

❤️ **Expanded Community Sponsorship Program**

As non-profit organizations, the **MAA Team** and **MirrorChyan**, after friendly discussions, have jointly launched a **Community Sponsorship Program**.

All revenue shares from **MirrorChyan**, as well as dedicated sponsorship funds, will be used **entirely** (after deducting necessary operational costs) to cover operational expenses for high-quality **Arknights community projects**.  
MAA does **not** participate in internal project operations and only provides logistical support.
