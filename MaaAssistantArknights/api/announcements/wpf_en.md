### 📢 [MAA × MirrorChyan] Update System Upgrade & Community Sponsorship Program

MAA has integrated **MirrorChyan** (a paid content distribution platform for open-source communities)

🤝 **Revenue Sharing**: MirrorChyan's proceeds will fund MAA's official site, copilot station, and server maintenance

❤️ **Expanded Community Sponsorship**  
As non-profit organizations, the MAA team and MirrorChyan, after discussions with partners, have decided to jointly launch a community sponsorship program. All revenue shares from MirrorChyan and dedicated sponsorship funds (after deducting necessary operational costs) will be used to cover operational expenses for quality Arknights community projects.

**Server costs have been covered for the following Ark community projects**:

1. [Penguin Statistics](https://penguin-stats.cn/)
2. [Arknights Yituliu](https://ark.yituliu.cn/)
3. [ARKREC WIKI](https://wiki.arkrec.com/)
4. [Arknights Roguelike Tactics](https://arkrog.com/)
5. [PRTS.Map](https://map.ark-nights.com/)
6. [AmiyaBot](https://www.amiyabot.com/)  
7. [Arknights Toolbox](https://arkntools.app/)

**Our Principles**:  
· Clear all existing server debts  
· Cover ongoing server/CDN costs  
· Zero interference with project autonomy
